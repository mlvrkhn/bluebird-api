# Søk mot Brønnøysundregisteret
### Tipio Case

## Create an app to communicate with API with Brønnøysundregisteret.

## Need to have:
- search based on organisasjonsnummer
- present the info in clear and nice way
- search based on user input with companys name
- starts searching when third letter is provided
- results should be continuously presented under the search field (live? I think)
- display info on click
- bankrupt companies are displayed with bold
- link to website and email

## Nice to have:
- more functionality if you want

## TODO
- Prop Types
  

## Project features:
- upload and use external fonts via file-loader,
- type checking with PropTypes,
- neumophic design,
- Redux state management with Thunk middleware,
- used Hooks: useState, useEffect, useDispatch, useSelector,
- Webpack and Babel configuration,
- 

## Not yet done
- independent, modular API communication,
